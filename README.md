# callsigner

Given a list of names, one per line, with optionally a parenthesized "priority" number (higher is more important), this program bijects the list of names, if possible, to a subset of the characters present (case-insensitively), in such a way as to maximize the extent that a name's assigned character follows mnemonically from the name.

## TODO

Biject to some *power* of a subset of the characters present, if needed.
